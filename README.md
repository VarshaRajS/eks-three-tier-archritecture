# eks-three-tier-archritecture

#### **Objective:**  
To build a **production-ready, cloud-agnostic, AI-enhanced, and secure** 3-tier architecture on AWS EKS, provisioned entirely through **CloudFormation (CFT) and CI/CD**. The infrastructure will feature **scalability, observability, security, and automation**, integrating **LLMs and external APIs** for advanced analytics, monitoring, and security.  

---

### **Scope & Features:**  

#### **1. Kubernetes & Infrastructure**  
- **EKS in Private Subnets**: Securely deployed with **2 nodes**, running frontend, backend, and database pods.  
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal and Cluster Autoscaler for demand-based scaling.  
- **Service Mesh with Sidecar Proxy**: Istio/Linkerd for observability, security (mTLS), and traffic management.  
- **Load Balancer & API Gateway**: AWS ALB/NLB with optional **non-AWS API Gateway** (Kong, Apigee, or Tyk).  

#### **2. CI/CD & Automation**  
- **Full CFT Provisioning**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup for **networking, EKS, and security**.  
- **CI/CD via GitHub Actions**: Auto-deployment of EKS configurations, application updates, and monitoring tools.  
- **GitOps with ArgoCD**: Declarative deployment management for versioned Kubernetes manifests.  

#### **3. Observability & Monitoring**  
- **Grafana + Prometheus**: Dashboards for cluster health, app metrics, and logs.  
- **AI-Based Incident Response**: LLMs analyze logs, suggest root causes, and propose fixes.  
- **Tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)**: End-to-end request flow visualization for debugging.  

#### **4. Security & Resilience**  
- **DDoS Protection**: AWS WAF + Shield, with **AI-driven anomaly detection** via ML models.  
- **Network & Pod Security**: Kubernetes **Network Policies, IAM least privilege, and RBAC**.  
- **Secret Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials.  
- **Self-Healing Workloads**: AI-powered remediation for failed pods and system anomalies.  

#### **5. AI & External APIs**  
- **LLM for Log Analysis**: Summarizes issues, suggests fixes, and provides **AI-driven Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**.  
- **ChatOps for DevOps**: Telegram/Slack bot to respond to cluster health queries.  
- **External Analytics APIs**: Google Analytics or Mixpanel for real-time user insights.
